  You will have to set g on line 33 to be the game you want to play. The options are tic and con for now.
  You will have to set opp1 on line 35 to be the opponent you want to play against. Options for each game are setup already
    For opp1 only select variables labeled with a 1 and the end
  You can set opp2 if you want to have the computer play itself. Default is None.
    For opp2 only select variables labeled with a 2 and the end
  You can also set which player goes first on line 39 by changing it to 1 or 0

  Picking a move requires a row and a column.
  Counting starts from top left and starts at 0
